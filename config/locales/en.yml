# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  faq_h1: "About our Rates"
  faq_b1: "Bibicoins prides it-self on our sterling record of timely delivery, service provision, and customer satisfaction."	
  faq_b1_1: "In response to the shifting landscape of Bitcoin prices in the world markets, we employ a proprietary model of rates based on the global averages of Bitcoin from the worlds leading Bitcoin exchanges. In the past, it was common to see providers base their rates solely on one exchange. However, to ensure our service remains robust and stable for the long-term, we, along with many of the worlds leading Bitcoin service providers, have recently begun moving toward a ‘Global Weighted Average’ system. This method of system ensures a more balanced equilibrium when unexpected market changes may occur, as well as reflect a truer price of the Global Bitcoin value."
  faq_h2: "Daily Buy/Sell Order Limits"
  faq_b2: "Currently the Buy/Sell order limit per day per customer is minimum NTD 3,000 and maximum NTD 300,000. "	
  faq_b2_1: "There are two reasons why we implement Daily Buy/Sell Order Limits.  The first is to assist in maintaining a healthy liquidity market balance between our Buy and Sell services.  In this respect, it is occasionally necessary to reduce or increase daily Buy and Sell limits, or briefly suspend service when pre-determined limits have been reached for the day. "	
  faq_b2_2: "The second reason is that we want to stay within the legal framework of the anti-money laundering laws of Taiwan. The purpose of bibicoins.com is to act as a place for convenient and trustworthy exchange of fiat currency to digital currency and the Limits in our view allows are customers to avoid time consuming account set-up and other onerous data collection that may be required for larger transactions."
  faq_h3: "Why can’t I use PayPal or Credit Card?"
  faq_b3: "Unfortunately due to reported cases where someone pays for Bitcoins with EFT (bank transfer, Credit Card, PayPal, etc.), receives the Bitcoins, then fraudulently complains that they never received their purchase to their EFT provider, a Chargeback often occurs, resulting in thefts from Bitcoin services providers such as ourselves. We are working to mitigate these risks and allow EFT purchases in the future."	
  faq_h4: "Buying Bitcoins"
  faq_b4: ""	
  faq_h5: "How Long does it take to receive Bitcoins?"
  faq_b5: "Usually we send Bitcoin within 2 to 4 hours of receiving payment. We recommend you buy Bitcoins during bank hours of operations. If it has been more than 4 hours since you have made your deposit and you haven’t received your Bitcoins, please contact us via email bibicoins@gmail.com or call us on: +886 922711415"	
  faq_h6: "Can I buy Bitcoins after hours and deposit the funds the next day?"
  faq_b6: "Yes, however buy orders are only valid 4 hours from the time you initiate your order. If we receive a payment for an order after our 4 hour cut off, we reserve the right (as per our T&C’s) to process your order at the current market rate, rather than to the rate at the time of the order. We suggest where possible that you resubmit a new order within 4 hours of making a deposit to ensure you get a locked in rate."	
  faq_h7: "How do you calculate your rates to buy Bitcoin?"
  faq_b7: "Our rates are based on the market rate buy price, plus the currency exchange buy rates and our service fee. This rate is live and refreshes constantly."	
  faq_h8: "What if I get my Wallet Address details wrong on my order?"
  faq_b8: "Contact us immediately on (+886) 922711415 or bibicoins@gmail.com and we will do our best to correct the order."	
  faq_b8_1: "Always double check your Bitcoin Wallet Address when placing your order. We cannot reverse the transaction once it is processed. If you provide the wrong Bitcoin Address your Bitcoins may end up in someone else’s wallet and there’s nothing that can be done to get them back."
  faq_h9: "Selling Bitcoins"	
  faq_b9: ""	
  faq_h10: "How long will it take for me to receive payment?"
  faq_b10: "Sell Requests are processed during business hours. Payments to Taiwan bank accounts will be received between 3 to 5 business days after you have submitted your request. This is dependent on bank processing times. Please contact us if you have not received your funds after this time; "	
  faq_h11: "Are you services available worldwide?"

# How to Protect Yourself Online
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  how_b1: "Internet fraud has been around for just about as long as the Internet itself. Each year, cybercriminals come up with new techniques and tactics designed to fool their potential victims. At Bibicoin we take your online protection and safety seriously. As such, the best protection that can be ever be under-taken is self-education, on-line safety awareness and prevention."
  how_b2: "There is one thing in particular that sets online fraud apart from other Internet threats like viruses, Trojans, spyware, SMS blockers, spam, etc: the target of the cybercriminals is not a computer, whose security has to be circumvented, but a human who, as we all know, has his/her own vulnerabilities. That is why no program can ever provide users with 100% protection; we our-selves have to take a proactive stance in ensuring our own online security and best interests are met."	
  how_b3: "While the vast majority of on-line financial transactions are successful and hassle-free, we always recommend internet users to follow these simple steps to ensure they get the best out of their online experiences:"
  how_b4: "Never send money to anyone you don’t know, nor make a payment on their (or any other 3rd parties) behalf"	
  how_b5: "If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably isn’t true"
  how_b6: "Always use common sense"

# About Wallets
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  wallets_h1: "To send and receive Bitcoins, you need a Bitcoin wallet. A wallet gives you ownership over Bitcoin addresses that you can use to receive coins from other users, and send to others. A wallet address will look something like this: “1Zvi22Q8Y3Cn6nPATEBSaFFbckD9sUq6C”."
  wallets_b1: ""	
  wallets_h2: "There are three types of wallets:"
  wallets_b2: ""	
  wallets_h3: "Web Wallets"
  wallets_b3: "Web wallets allow you to use Bitcoins and generally require less effort from you to protect your wallet. Web Wallets may also be referred to as "	
  wallets_b3a: "'Browser-based wallets' or 'eWallets'"	
  wallets_b3b: ". This method is generally the easiest way to obtain a Bitcoin wallet. However, you need to choose your web wallet service provider with care as they host and hold your Bitcoins."	
  wallets_b3c: "eWallet Examples: "
  wallets_b3d: "BlockChain"
  wallets_b3e: " » Reputable, also provide Hybrid eWallets so that your wallet is encrypted before it reaches their server."
  wallets_h4: "Software Wallets"
  wallets_b4: "Software wallets are installed on your computer. They give you complete control over your wallet. You are responsible for backups and protecting your Bitcoin. "	
  wallets_h5: "Works everywhere, anytime"
  wallets_b5: "Mobile wallets allow you to have Bitcoins stored on your mobile device. You can exchange coins easily and pay in physical stores by scanning a QR code or using “tap to pay”. "	
  wallets_h6: "What is Bitcoin Wallet?"
  wallets_b6: "To send and receive bitcoins, you need a bitcoin wallet. A bitcoin wallet gives you ownership over bitcoin addresses that you can use to receive coins from other users and send those coins on."	
  wallets_h7: "A bitcoin address – looks like this;"
  wallets_b7: "1Zvi22Q8Y3Cn6nPATEBSaFFbckD9sUq6C"	
  wallets_b7_1: "Each bitcoin address has a matching private key that allows bitcoins to be spent. These private keys are saved in the bitcoin wallet of the person who owns the bitcoin address, thus whoever has the private keys of a particular bitcoin address can spend the unspent bitcoin of that address."
  wallets_h8: "But where are the Bitcoins actually kept? "	
  wallets_b8: "The total balance of a bitcoin address is kept on a ledger called the BlockChain. The BlockChain records each and every bitcoin transaction. Bitcoin transactions are verified and recorded into the BlockChain by bitcoin miners. Bitcoin miners perform this service by solving complex puzzles that require computing power, processor cycles, which in turn requires electricity. As a reward for their work, bitcoin miners receive new bitcoins and small transaction fees paid by users sending bitcoin. As bitcoin mining becomes more competitive, the difficulty of the puzzles increase – ensuring that the supply of bitcoin is maintained at a steady and pre-defined rate. "	
  wallets_h9: "How do I get a Bitcoin Wallet? "
  wallets_b9: "There are a number of ways to get a Bitcoin Wallet, but before we get into that let’s go through a few general security principles you should keep in mind."	
  wallets_h10: "Use Strong Passwords"
  wallets_b10: "Passwords can be cracked by brute force. An attacker can run software to try many different combinations of letters, words, and numbers to crack your password. The best way to defend against a brute force attack is to have a strong password. A strong password is like having a large haystack, with your attacker trying to find a needle in that haystack. A higher entropy is what gives you that haystack. A mnemonic sequence of random words is a good way to create a strong password that is also memorable."	
  wallets_h11: ""
  wallets_b11: "Find out how secure your password is (don’t type in any real passwords to this site please!)"	
  wallets_h12: "Multi-Factor Authentication "
  wallets_b12: "Multi-factor authentication requires an authentication factor additional to your password. This could be something you know; a secret question, for example. It could be something you are; human, because you can read squiggly writing (Captcha). Or it could be something you posses; a mobile phone or token. Some wallet providers require you to enter a pin number generated from software running on your smartphone, such as Authy or Google Authenticator. This adds an additional layer of security and is a feature you should take the time to activate. "	
  wallets_h13: "Encrypt Private Keys"
  wallets_b13: "Private keys can be stored in plain text – which means anyone with access to this file can potentially spend your bitcoins. Make sure you encrypt your private keys. (this is the default with many bitcoin wallets) This might be a bit confusing, just think of it as a key to your key. (Did you know you should also keep your house keys hidden from plain sight, as it is possible for attackers to covertly duplicate your keys from a photograph of it.)"	
  wallets_h14: "Open Source"
  wallets_b14: "Open source software allows anyone to review the source code and make sure that it does what it says. Security flaws are flagged and fixed quicker than closed source software. With many people looking at the code, open source software is far superior to closed source software when it comes to security. It is for this reason that much of the world’s financial system runs on Linux, an open-source operating system. Except ATMs, which mostly run Windows XP! No wonder credit-card skimming is so rife. "	
  wallets_h15: "Backup Backup Backup "
  wallets_b15: "Make sure the private keys to your bitcoin addresses are backed up in at least 3 different locations, 2 of those locations should be geographically separate. If you keep only one copy of your bitcoin wallet (therefore your private keys), not if but when your hard-drive dies – it will most likely be unrecoverable. Statistically, say your hard-drives have a 1 in 500 chance of failing over a period of a year. With a second hard-drive backing up your data, that chance would reduce to 1 in 250,000. With a third, it would reduce by another order of magnitude. And few of us have perfect memories, so backup your password – write it on a piece of paper and store it in a secure place. "	
  wallets_h16: "Trust No One"
  wallets_b16: "Bitcoin is revolutionary in that you don’t need to trust any third party to use it. If you engage with third-party service providers, such as ourselves, make sure you do your homework – are you able to identify the third party so as to be able to seek recourse? A classic bitcoin scam would be to setup a bitcoin bank, take deposits, and then vanish with depositors Bitcoins! You could then claim to be the victim of an attack, as the attacker could remain anonymous – much more easily than a traditional bank robber. But hey, at least bitcoin thiefs do it with flair!"	
  wallets_h17: ""
  wallets_b17: "Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your Bitcoin."	
  wallets_h18: "Who’s Going To Look After Your Bitcoin When You’re Gone? "
  wallets_b18: "Lastly, bitcoin does not come with a friendly customer service representative who will transfer your bitcoin to your loved ones when you cark it. Unless you give specific instructions of your wallets or your passwords, no one will be able to recover your bitcoins. If your bitcoins are lost forever you will make everyone who has bitcoin a little bit richer through deflation, but you probably have better plans than that. "

# Bitcoin Vs Traditional Currencies
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  traditional_b1: "In many ways Bitcoin is similar to traditional currencies: it is recognised and has a value, it can be used to buy things, and its value can change according to market variables. Increased demand for Bitcoin over the last few years has seen an increase in its circulation and its value.
Unlike most traditional currencies, however, Bitcoin is not bound to an institution or country. It is in a sense, international, and it is not subject to authorities like banks or governments that are typically associated with other currencies."	
  traditional_b2: "Despite being manufactured around complex technology, Bitcoin actually springs from a simple concept: that people all over the world, from any class or country, can exchange products, services and credits freely, instantly and easily – without the need for intermediary bodies like banks, merchant accounts or payment gateways. In a way it is a throwback to a purer form of trade, and it is for this reason that the potential and future of digital currencies has generated a lot of interest and investment. In today’s free, global and digital market, Bitcoin is standing up as a robust and recognised form of payment."	
  traditional_b3: "Bitcoin is based on some fundamental characteristics of currency (or any thing of worth for that matter). In fact, Bitcoin follows the characteristics of a common pillar of today’s traditional currency market: gold. Like gold, Bitcoin is bound by some real world principles. Firstly, it needs to be reasonably difficult to produce (or find). Secondly, it needs to have a limited supply. And thirdly, it needs to be recognised."	
  traditional_b4: "Like gold, Bitcoin is governed by principles that can’t now be changed. Bitcoin technology can only ever produce a certain amount of Bitcoins. The more Bitcoins that are produced, the harder it is to create new ones. In this way, the value of Bitcoins is being regulated. Because of its parallels with gold, the production of Bitcoins is referred to as “mining”. Computers can be purchased that evaluate the complex Bitcoin algorithm and produce Bitcoins. The speed at which a Bitcoin computer can produce Bitcoins is mostly determined by its processing speed. A computer designed to produce Bitcoins is known as a “Bitcoin miner”."	
  traditional_b5: "Historically, humanity has used a variety of methods to trade other than just traditional money. Payment has often been made in produce or in services, and in some societies people have less need for money. Currencies do, however, fix some problems associated with trading in products and services, but even traditional currencies have some disadvantages. For one, trading with people internationally often involves the management of one or several third-parties, for example, a bank and a credit card company. The provision of these facilities has created opportunity, but it is also making a simple exchange more complicated and regulated than it needs to be, especially given today’s connectivity."	
  traditional_b6: "Bitcoin’s purpose is to get around the disadvantages of trading in traditional currencies. It provides an instantaneous, free and reliable way of exchanging goods and services with people over the world. This, combined with the principles over which it has been built, has seen Bitcoin become one of the most exciting currency advancements over recent years and similar systems may evolve in conjunction with Bitcoin to facility easy, free, and fast exchange of goods and services."

# Why Use Bitcoins
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  bitcoins_h1: "Mobile payments made easy"	
  bitcoins_b1: "Bitcoin on mobiles allows you to pay with a simple two step scan-and-pay. No need to sign up, swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything. All you need to receive Bitcoin payments is to display the QR code in your Bitcoin wallet app and let your friend scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology)."	
  bitcoins_h2: "Security and control over your money"	
  bitcoins_b2: "Bitcoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can charge you money or make a payment on your behalf. So long as you take the required steps to protect your wallet, Bitcoin can give you control over your money and a strong level of protection against many types of fraud."	
  bitcoins_h3: "Works everywhere, anytime"	
  bitcoins_b3: "Just like with email, you don't need to ask your family to use the same software or the same service providers. Just let them stick to their own favorites. No problem there; they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. The Bitcoin network never sleeps, even on holidays!"	
  bitcoins_h4: "Fast international payments"	
  bitcoins_b4: "Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. There is no bank to slow down the process, level outrageous fees, or freeze the transfer. You can pay your neighbors the same way as you can pay a member of your family in another country."	
  bitcoins_h5: "Zero or low fees"	
  bitcoins_b5: "Bitcoin allows you to send and receive payments at very low cost. Except for special cases like very small payments, there is no enforced fee. It is however recommended to pay a higher voluntary fee for faster confirmation of your transaction and to remunerate the people who operate the Bitcoin network."	
  bitcoins_h6: "Protect your identity"	
  bitcoins_b6: "With Bitcoin, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even possible to send a payment without revealing your identity, almost just like with physical money. You should however take note that some effort can be required to protect your privacy."	
  bitcoins_h7: "For more information on Bitcoins, please refer to the below link for details!"
